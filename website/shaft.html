            Overview
          </h1>
          <p class="description">
            In this project, our team is dedicated to redesign the individual dorm pages for theShaft. The purpose of this 
            website is to assist students in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the campus housing options at Columbia 
            University. Our primary objective is to integrate a 360 room tour feature that would offer immersive and comprehensive 
            viewing of the campus dorms, providing students with invaluable information to make informed housing decisions. Please 
            keep in mind that this project is ongoing.
          </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">
          1 - Current Design
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
          Two main things to highlight on the current page are (1) the first image that is on the screen is too big for 
          one's screen and (2) the information on the side bar sticks to the page.
        </p>

        <img src="shaft2.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
        <img src="shaft1.png" style="width: 100%;"/>

        <h1 class="subtitle">
          2 - Pain Points
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
          We recognized that some of the pain points of the current website included: <br> <br>
          - Inadequate view of room <br>
          - Incorrect layout sizing <br>
          - Outdated reviews <br>

        </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">
          3 - Research
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
          In our research, we mainly focused on the first pain point.  <br> <br>

          To gain a better understanding of how to approach the redesign, we conducted a <strong> comparative analysis </strong>of other universities' 
          dorm websites to explore how they allowed students to view their prospective dorms. Some examples include photos with 
          panoramic views, real-life floor plans, videos, and interactive room tours.
          <br> 
          <br>
          These were some designs we looked at during the comparative analysis:
          <br>
          <img src="shaft3.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
          <br>
          <br>
          After conducting a comprehensive analysis, we presented our findings to <strong>randomly sampled Columbia University students </strong> 
          through a short interview. This interview enabled us to ascertain the efficacy of our identified features and also to 
          gain valuable insights into the students' interaction patterns with other online platforms, thereby informing our 
          decision-making process regarding feature inclusion and exclusion.
          <br> <br> <br>
          The <strong> main conclusions </strong> are as follows:<br> <br>
          - Users prefer simplistic design features that are intuitive; less is more <br>
          - Users would rather see their room in a separate, full screen tab if utilizing the 360 room tour or video<br>
          - Users prefer if we stick to one type of multimedia<br>
          - Managing board decided that although 360 room tour would be most ideal for the students, the current
           budget does not support it

        </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">
          4 - Design Opportunities
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
          - <strong>Video Room Tour</strong>: Students can play a video of their choice of dorm in a separate, full screen tab to explore 
          spaces that photos cannot otherwise depict. The full screen tab will have a small drop down menu for users to 
          choose which room they would like to see. <br> <br>

          - <strong>Layout Resizing</strong>: We will re-do some of the layout so that students can now see entire photos or features without having 
          to scroll. This would help the readability and comprehension of the website.

        </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">
          5 - Mockup Design
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
          As this project has already been worked on in the past, my team and I merely altered the existing prototype to include
          a new page with a video room tour as shown in the preliminary prototype. We are still exploring more prototype ideas.

          <img src="shaft5.png" style="width: 100%;"/> <br>
          <img src="shaft6.png" style="width: 100%;"/> <br>

          6 - Current Assessments
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
          As this is an ongoing project, we are now conducting further interviews on the protypes we have made to finalize the placement of 
          buttons on the page that would allow for the best and easiest user experience. Following the analysis of the data, we
          will design the final protype version that will be sent off to the engineering team.

          7 - Reflection On Current Progress
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
          In my first project as a product manager, I have had the privilege of gaining invaluable experience in leading 
          open discussions aimed at enhancing our existing website. My responsibilities have extended to orchestrating the 
          interview processes, making definitive design decisions following analysis, and communicating seamlessly 
          cross-sectionally. I am excited to continue learning more as a product manager. Please stay tuned as I will continue to
          share more about this re-design throughout this semester!
